## Kinich Ahau Powhatan

The Powhatan Confederacy waged three wars against the British Crown, each echoing the scale and fervor of the Anglo-Scottish Wars. A battle for land and sovereignty that ended with the genocide and enslavement of the Powhatan people. [36]

We are the direct descendants of the Powhatan Confederacy, the tribe portrayed in the Disney movie Pocahontas, and led by Ashton James Snow Jefferson (Morris), a Software Engineer and Native American Chief.

Despite the many adversities we faced—including the loss of land, forced assimilation, war, slavery, the death of our culture, and, finally, genocide— we've maintained our original reservation on our ancestral lands, first documented by the English and the Spaniards in the 1500s.

We predate the existence of the United States of America, from the perspective of the United Kingdom, by 215 years. Our documented history stretches from 1561 to 2024; more than 463 years of written record. [32]

We're petitioning the Bureau of Indian Affairs and every U.S state except Hawaii for tribal recognition, focusing on areas where Clovis cultures have been found.

Amongst others, our sibling tribes the Pamunkey received 1,200 acres from the Commonwealth of Virginia [142]; and the Powhatan Renape have received 350 acres from the State of New Jersey. [24] Historically, the Powhatan Confederacy's reservation was 8,000 square miles. [2]

### America's first progressive tribe

Our goal is to build a micro-nation of provinces across the United States of America, Canada, Mexico and the West Indies that will showcase the ingenuity, culture, and spirit of our people.

These developments will not only serve as cultural landmarks but also provide economic opportunities and modern amenities for our communities and the citizens of the countries that recognize and help conserve our people.

Powhatan wishes to invite all U.S citizens, like Latino and Black Indians, who can verify their Indigenous American ancestry with DNA testing platforms like 23andMe to join our tribe. By blending these distinct Indigenous sub-cultures, we have the opportunity to enrich the cultural tapestry of America in profound and meaningful ways.

COVID-19 Relief: As we build our community, we are committed to providing COVID-19 relief to our tribal members and others in need, including access to healthcare, vaccinations, food assistance, and economic support. This is crucial for protecting the health and well-being of our people as we move forward together.
